Infrastructure Funding Plan
===========================

The purpose of the Infrastructure Funding Plan (IFP) is to provide funding to development projects working on common Bitcoin Cash infrastructure. If activated, it enforces that 5% of the block reward is spent to one of a set of specified addresses.

## IFP Destination Addresses

The IFP contains four destination addresses, each associated with a separate BIP 9 activation `bit` as follows:

| Name                         | Destination Address                        | BIP 9 `bit` |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| MinerFundDestination         | pqv2r67sgz3qumufap3h2uuj0zfmnzuv8vqhqfgddk | 0           |
| MinerABCDestination          | qzvz0es48sf8wrqy7kn5j5cugka95ztskcanc9laay | 1           |
| MinerBCHDDestination         | qrhea03074073ff3zv9whh0nggxc7k03ssh8jv9mkx | 2           |
| MinerElectronCashDestination | pp8d685l8kecnmtyy52ndvq625arz2qwmu42qeeqek | 3           |

## Activation

Activation is triggered separately for each destination address via [BIP 9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki), with the following parameters:
* `activation threshold` is set to 1344 (which is ~66.6% of the 2016 block retarget periods)
* `starttime` is set to 1573819200 (Nov 15, 2019 12:00:00 UTC)
* `timeout` is set to 1589544000 (May 15, 2020 12:00:00 UTC ** note:** this is the same time as the May 15, 2020 upgrade activation)
* `bit` is set according to the table above.

## Enforcement

If activated, the IFP enforcement begins once the 15th May 2020 upgrade is activated.

If one or more IFP destination addresses are activated, then the coinbase transaction in each block must contain an output sending 5% of the block reward to one of the activated addresses.
